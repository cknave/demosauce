demosauce - fancy icecast source client

BUILDING
==================
officially we support only linux (tested on ubuntu, gentoo), but the code is written with portability in mind.

Libraries
------------------
required libs:
boost, libsamplerate, libshout, libicu, libavcodec, libavformat

required programs:
lame (or any other mp3 encoder that reads from stdin)

optional libs:
ladspa-sdk, bass, libid3tag

you can use BASS for module playback (mod, s3m, xm, it files). you can get the binaries for your system here http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html. extract the bass.h header file and bass.so/bass.dll for your platform. libid3tag is required for bass.

Unix-Like
------------------
first run configure.sh. it will ask a few questions and generate a simple build script called makebelieve.sh. if not, you most probaply miss a lib (the last checked). then run makebelieve.sh. 

Linux
------------------
we provide a script (contrib/installDependencies.sh) to install the required libraries which you will need to run as root.

OSX
------------------
you will need to install the required libraries manually.

BSD
------------------
no bass support for bsd. installDependencies.sh could be patched to work with bsd flavours, maybe YOU can help :D

Windows
------------------
you're on your own for now. if you manage to build it, maybe you can share your experience (and project files).

SETUP
==================
copy contrib/demosauce.conf.example to demosauce.conf. then edit it. the comments should help you with that.
