BUILDING
==================
officially we support only linux (tested on ubuntu, gentoo), but the code is written fully portable.

LINUX
run sudo installDependencies.sh or su -c installDependencies.sh to install some packages that are needed. then run ./makebelieve.sh to build the source client & friends.
if you want to change the build configuration (like disabling bass) you have to edit ./makebelieve.sh and comment/uncomment a few lines.

OSX
you need to install the required libraries yourself. ./makebelieve.sh may still work.

BSD
you'll have to disable bass. installDependencies.sh could be patched to work with bsd flavours, maybe YOU can help :D

WINDOWS
you're on your own for now. if you manage to build it, maybe you can share your experience (and project files).

SETUP
==================
copy or rename demosauce.conf.example to demosauce.conf. then edit it. the comments should help you with that.

LICENSE
==================
GPL, google it yourself
