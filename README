BUILDING
==================
officially we support only linux (tested on ubuntu, gentoo), but the code is written fully portable.

LINUX
run sudo installDependencies.sh or su -c installDependencies.sh to install some packages that are needed. then run ./makebelieve.sh to build the source client & friends.
if you want to change the build configuration (like disabling bass) you have to edit ./makebelieve.sh and comment/uncomment a few lines.

OSX
you need to install the required libraries yourself. ./makebelieve.sh may still work.

BSD
you'll have to disable bass. installDependencies.sh could be patched to work with bsd flavours, maybe YOU can help :D

WINDOWS
you're on your own for now. if you manage to build it, maybe you can share your experience (and project files).

SETUP
==================
copy or rename demosauce.conf.example to demosauce.conf. then edit it. the comments should help you with that.

LICENSE
==================
GPL, google it yourself

FAQ
==================
if you have a question, contact me (maep) via irc: #nectarine on irc.eu.esper.net

what per-song settings are support?
the first value is the default value:
gain        : <replay gain value>
length      : <force length in seconds, 0 = disabled>
fade_out    : false | true
mix         : auto, 0.0 - 0.5
bass_inter  : auto | off | linear | sinc
bass_ramp   : auto | off | normal | sensitive
bass_mode   : auto | pt1 | ft2
