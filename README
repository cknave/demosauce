demosauce - fancy icecast source client

BUILDING
==================
officially we support only linux (tested on ubuntu, gentoo), but the code is written with portability in mind.

Libraries
------------------
required libs:
boost, libsamplerate, libshout, libicu, libavcodec, libavformat

required programs:
lame (or any other mp3 encoder that reatd from stdin)

optional libs:
ladspa-sdk, bass, libid3tag

you can use BASS for module playback (mod, s3m, xm, it files) you should get the binaries for your system here http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html. extract the bass.h header file and bass.so/bass.dll for your platform.  libid3tag is required for bass.

Unix-Like
------------------
if you're building in a unix-like environment, edit the build script "makebelieve.sh" to customize (it's easy!). the comments inside the file will guide you. after youre done, run ./makebelieve.sh to build the source client & friends.

Linux
------------------
we provide a script to install the required libraries calld installDependencies.sh which you will need to run as root.

OSX
------------------
you will need to install the required libraries manually.

BSD
------------------
no bass support for bsd. installDependencies.sh could be patched to work with bsd flavours, maybe YOU can help :D

Windows
------------------
you're on your own for now. if you manage to build it, maybe you can share your experience (and project files).

SETUP
==================
copy or rename demosauce.conf.example to demosauce.conf. then edit it. the comments should help you with that.

LICENSE
==================
GPL
